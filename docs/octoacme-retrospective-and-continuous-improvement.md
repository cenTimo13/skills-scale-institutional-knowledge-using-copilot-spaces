# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- **Facilitator**: Scrum Master (or PM for non-agile projects)
- **Participants**: All delivery team members (Developers, Technical Lead, QA Lead, UX Designer), PM, PdM
- **Optional attendees**: Business Analyst, Stakeholder Champion (for major milestones)
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload

For role details, see [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items

- Scrum Master or PM tracks action item completion
- Share learnings across teams through retrospective summaries
