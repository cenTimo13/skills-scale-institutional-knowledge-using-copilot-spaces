# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. **Kickoff meeting** with stakeholders and delivery team
   - Attendees: PM, PdM, Technical Lead, Scrum Master, key Developers, QA Lead, UX Designer, Business Analyst, Stakeholder Champion
2. **Create prioritized backlog** with acceptance criteria (led by PdM with Business Analyst)
3. **Estimate scope** (T-shirt sizing or story points - Developers and Technical Lead)
4. **Define Definition of Done (DoD)** (collaborative - QA Lead, Technical Lead, Scrum Master)
5. **Identify dependencies and integration points** (Technical Lead, PM)
6. **Create release plan and milestone map** (PM with input from all roles)

For role-specific responsibilities, see [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).
